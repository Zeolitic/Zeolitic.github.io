  <div class="center" id="sketch-holder"></div>
  <br>
  <p>The demo shows a perlin noise based flow field with particles dropped onto it.</p>
  <p>The particles also have some seperation forces applied to them so they do not clump up.</p>
  <p>Improved Distance function for seperation to make simualtion run quicker.</p>
