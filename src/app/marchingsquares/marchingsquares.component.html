  <p>The demo shows the marching squares algorithm working to show a cave. The cave is generated from random numbers and then I apply a "smoothing" algorithm which I created onto the cave.</p>
  <p>Then when hovering with the "Show Rays" options toggled, we can see some basic ray casting on the cave.</p>
